# Ledger Helper Scripts

## Prerequisites

Scripts are tested with

- macOS Mojave 10.14
- ledger-cli version 3.1.1
- gnuplot version 5.2 patchlevel 5
- bash version 4.4.23

Monthly ledger reports can be generated by running

```bash
./reports YYYY/mm

# Example
./reports 2016/12
```

Before running, make sure to define a few variables,

```bash
# Ledger file to use
export LEDGER_FILE="path/to/ledger/general.ledger"

# Price db to use
export LEDGER_PRICE_DB="path/to/ledger/prices.ledger"

# Directory to place the reports
export LEDGER_REPORT_DIR="/path/to/ledger/reports/"
```

Optionally, I like to alias the entry point.

```bash
alias ledreports="~/path/to/reports.sh"
```
