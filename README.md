# Ledger Helper Scripts

Monthly ledger reports can be generated by running

```bash
./reports [YEAR/MONTH]
```

Before running, make sure to define a few variables,

```bash
# Ledger file to use
export LEDGER_FILE="path/to/ledger/general.ledger"

# Price db to use
export LEDGER_PRICE_DB="path/to/ledger/prices.ledger"

# Directory to place the reports
export LEDGER_REPORT_DIR="/path/to/ledger/reports/"

# Optionally, I like to alias it
alias ledreports="~/reports.sh"
```
