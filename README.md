# Ledger Report Scripts

Scripts are tested with

- macOS Mojave 10.14
- ledger-cli version 3.1.1
- gnuplot version 5.2 patchlevel 5
- bash version 4.4.23

### Setup

In order to run any of the reports, some flags need to be set in your local `~/.ledgerrc`.
```sh
--f ~/path/to/ledger/data/general.ledger
# not a bad idea to specify your prices-db file,
# and mark the --exchange flag as well with your base currency
# so that reports have a consistent exchange (for me its US$)
--price-db ~/path/to/ledger/pricesdb/prices.ledger
--exchange $
```

The global variable `LEDGER_REPORTS_OUTPUT_DIR` has to be set too. This is probably easiest if stored in your .bash_profile.
```sh
# The directory where the reports script will output to
LEDGER_REPORTS_OUTPUT_DIR="~/path/to/ledger/reports/output"
```

Optionally, I like to alias the entry point.

```bash
alias ledreports="~/path/to/reports.sh"
```


Monthly ledger reports can be generated by running

```bash
./reports YYYY/mm

# Example
./reports 2016/12
```
